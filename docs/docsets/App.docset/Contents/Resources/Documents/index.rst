Swiftarr
========

`swiftarr` is the back-end engine of Twit-arr, implementing API v3. `swiftarr` is unsurprisingly written entirely in
Swift, using the asynchronous Vapor framework built on SwiftNIO. `swiftarr` runs whereever server-side Swift
is officially supported, which is currently limited to macOS or Linux (Ubuntu).
