## Contributing to `swiftarr`

### General

Anybody should feel free to open or comment on an [issue](https://github.com/grundoon/swiftarr/issues)! This is
the preferred place to consolidate discussion related specifically to the `swiftarr` API backend. Questions,
general feedback, suggestions, feature requests, bug reports, and proposed changes are all fair game.

While it *is* the preferred location, a (free) GitHub account is required to participate there directly. The Twit-arr
developers collectively participate in (or at least monitor to some extent) related Slack channels, the various
Facebook groups, and the feedback forums within Twit-arr itself when it is active, so any of those places are
also fine-ish.
