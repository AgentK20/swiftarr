						<h5>About Alt Accounts</h5>
						<p>An alt account lets you post as someone else, while still being yourself. If, for example, you run a certain type of Shadow Event, you might make an alt account named after the event you run. You can then post about your event in a way that makes it clear you're the one running it, and still switch back to your main account when chatting with your friends.</p>
						<p>Remember that all your accounts are subject to the Code of Conduct, and are all jointly subject to the rulings of the moderators.</p>

							<p>Due to technical restrictions, the security available on the ship is akin to <b>writing your password on a post-it and placing the post-it on your forehead.</b> At least, it is to anyone skilled and motivated to do such things.</p>
