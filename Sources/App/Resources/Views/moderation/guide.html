<h2>Twit-arr Moderator Guidelines</h2>
<p>Welcome to Twit-arr V3, moderator. This guide will show you the tools you&rsquo;ll be using to perform moderation tasks, and also gude you as to when and how to use those tools properly.</p>
<p>Right up front though, the Moderator Manifesto: Expanded functionality has been added to Twit-arr. Moderators will work to help the Community thrive in a positive manner.</p>
<h3>Part 1: Twit-arr Concepts</h3>
<h4>Users</h4>
<p>Like previous Twit-arr servers, V3 requires users to provide a Registration Code when creating their account. Unlike previous versions, V3 lets users create multiple accounts, all of which are tied to their Registration Code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>User Access Levels</strong></p>
<div>
<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Unverified</td>
<td>Account created, but no reg code. Limited access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Banned</td>
<td>Cannot log in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quarantined</td>
<td>Can read, but not post.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Verified</td>
<td>Most users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client</td>
<td>Special access level for applications to use bulk-access APIs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Moderator</td>
<td>That&rsquo;s you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TwitarrTeam</td>
<td>Developers and IT support</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>THO (The Home Office)</td>
<td>Drew&rsquo;s account, I think. Can ban users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Admin</td>
<td>Server admin</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>You will need to create an account normally with the Reg Code you received from THO, and get elevated to Moderator access by someone with THO level access. If you wish, you can create a sub-account specifically for moderator duties and get that account elevated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a mod, you&rsquo;ll be able to set a Verified user&rsquo;s access level to Quarantined, either temporarily or permanently. This will affect all accounts tied to that user&rsquo;s Reg Code.</p>
<h4>Content</h4>
<p>Twit-arr has multiple types of content users may create, and every publicly viewable piece of content a user can create can be reported by any other user (reported to the moderation team) and moderated by you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Content Types</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tweets (aka twarrts, aka stream posts)</li>
<li>Forums (the forum itself, really just the forum title)</li>
<li>Forum Posts</li>
<li>Looking For Group (the LFG&rsquo;s title and info)</li>
<li>LFG Posts (a post in an LFG thread)</li>
<li>User Profile</li>
</ul>
<p>For each listed content type, verified users may create content of that type and edit the content they created. Tweets, Forum Posts, and LFG posts may also be deleted by the author. All of the above content types keep an edit trail showing every edit made to the content-&mdash;users can&rsquo;t post something nasty and delete it 20 seconds later, hoping the mods won&rsquo;t see it in time.</p>
<p>As a mod, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit content any user created,</li>
<li>Delete all content types except User Profiles,</li>
<li>Lock content to prevent the author from editing it,</li>
<li>Quarantine content (hides content&mdash;useful while you confer with other mods),</li>
<li>Move forum threads to a new category, including moving threads to &ldquo;Mods Only Dumpster Fire&rdquo; a special category only mods can see.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, you can moderate content by tapping the &ldquo;Mod&rdquo; button next to the content. Only Moderators will see this button. The Mod button opens a page showing the content, all previous edits to the content, users reports against the content, and controls for performing moderation actions.</p>
<p>Only THO and Admin level users may ban users. If you think a user should be banned you should open a thread about it in the Moderator Forum.</p>
<p>You should know that all actions you take that use your Mod powers get logged, and all Mods will be able to see what you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<h4>Reports</h4>
<p>Mods have access to the &ldquo;Moderator Pages&rdquo; section of the web client; tap on the Twit-arr header item to open the menu and Moderator Pages should be there if you have Moderator access. Inside Moderator Pages is a page that lets you view open user reports.</p>
<p>Users can report content they think moderators should take a look at. Being users however, they may report the wrong thing. Most often this will be users reporting on a <em>forum</em> when they mean to report on a particular <em>forum post</em>. Also, users cannot directly report other users&mdash;they can only report content they&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>While not necessary, while viewing reports on some content you can tap &ldquo;Start Handling All&rdquo; to mark the reports as in-process by you. This lets other mods know which reports are being handled and which are not-yet-handled. You may then edit the content, delete the content, quarantine the content, give the user a timeout, or take no action at all. You should hit the &ldquo;Close All&rdquo; button when you&rsquo;re done so the user reports will be marked as having been dealt with.</p>
<h4>Moderation Actions</h4>
<p>The Moderation page for all types of content is essentially the same, and displays the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit: </strong>Lets the moderator modify the content, changing text and removing images.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Delete: </strong>Removes the content entirely. If you do this for a forum or a LFG, all the posts within are also inaccessible. For forums it may be preferable to move the forum into a Moderator-only category, especially if there are multiple bad actors posting within the forum. User Profiles can&rsquo;t be deleted&mdash;a user always has exactly one profile.</li>
<li><strong>Lock: </strong>The author of the content cannot modify it. If applied to a Forum or LFG, users cannot create new posts within.</li>
<li><strong>Quarantine:</strong> Setting the Quarantine state on content changes its text to &ldquo;Under Moderator Review&rdquo; and removes images for all non-moderators who view it. The moderator can then discuss what to do in the moderator forums, or finish eating lunch, whatever. Removing Quarantine (setting state back to &ldquo;Normal&rdquo;) returns the content to its original state.</li>
<li><strong>Moderator Reviewed: </strong>Setting this state means you&rsquo;ve looked at the content and determined you need to take no action. See section on Auto-Quarantine.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate User:</strong> If you want to moderate the user instead of the content, this will take you to the User moderation page.</li>
</ul>
<p>The User Moderation page shows the user&rsquo;s primary account, all sub-accounts, and all reports against content the user has created, on any of their accounts. The following actions are available to moderate the user:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quarantine User:</strong> A Quarantined user is unable to create or modify content. This means they cannot post, create forums, edit or delete their posts, create LFGs or post in them, or edit their profile.</li>
<li><strong>Temp Quarantine: </strong>Same as Quarantine, but only lasts for a number of hours that you select.</li>
<li><strong>Un-Quarantine: </strong>Returns the user&rsquo;s accounts to the &ldquo;verified&rdquo; state, so they can post again.</li>
<li><strong>Ban: </strong>Only THO-level users have this option. Prevents the user from logging in with any of their accounts, which in turn means they cannot see any user-generated content. The home page (announcements and Daily Theme) and the Schedule are still accessible while logged out.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Auto-Quarantine</h4>
<p>When a certain number of users report on the same piece of content, that content can become auto-quarantined. Auto-quarantine acts just like a mod-issued quarantine&mdash;the content&rsquo;s text is replaced with &ldquo;Under Moderator Review&rdquo; and all images are removed. This feature exists to help prevent offensive content from being posted with impunity late at night when the mods are asleep.</p>
<p>By definition, auto-quarantined content will have a bunch of reports filed against it. When you look at the moderation page for that content, you&rsquo;ll see the Moderation State of the content set to &ldquo;auto-quarantined&rdquo;. You should probably change the state of the content (even if it&rsquo;s to &ldquo;quarantined&rdquo;) before closing the open reports.</p>
<p>If the reported content doesn&rsquo;t seem offensive (be sure to check the previous edits), it&rsquo;s possible clever users have teamed up to &lsquo;brigade&rsquo; the content. This is where several users all report on the same non-offensive content on purpose in an attempt to get it auto-quarantined. This is when you can set the &ldquo;Moderator Reviewed&rdquo; state on the content. Content that is in the &ldquo;Moderator Reviewed&rdquo; state is immune to being auto-quarantined.</p>
<h3>Part 2: Considerations for Moderators</h3>
<p>The task of the moderators is to ensure users are not posting content contrary to the JoCo Cruise Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to clarify any methods that might be used to quell the community in this type of situation. For instance, a Moderator may want to say things like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on finding out more information,&rdquo; until they can actually say more.</p>
<p>If a Moderator is not sure about something &ndash; ask another moderator in the private moderator Seamail. If no response is received, please escalate the issue.</p>
<p>Issue Categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeats Behavior after being asked to stop</li>
<li>Possibly Mean</li>
<li>Actively Mean</li>
<li>Possibly Offensive (Hate speech, racism, transphobia, ableism, homophobia, classism, religious discrimination)</li>
<li>Actively Offensive (Hate speech, racism, transphobia, ableism, homophobia, classism, religious discrimination)</li>
</ul>
<h4>The steps to address issues</h4>
<p>IF content is considered Possibly Mean or Possibly Offensive &gt; THEN alert private mod group discussion for feedback, seek to clarify the intent with the User via SeaMail. Consider adding to the thread to clarify, as well. If the User does not respond, consider locking content temporarily. Ask User to edit or delete.</p>
<p>IF content is considered Actively Mean or Actively Offensive &gt; THEN lock content, contact the User via Sea Mail, alert private mod group discussion, take it from there. Edit and/or delete as necessary.</p>
<p>Often a stern but reasonable request to redirect the direction of a thread is enough. If you&rsquo;re worried by where it might be headed, or the overall tone, it&rsquo;s perfectly okay to drop in and just say so. It&rsquo;s a good heads up to posters (who may not have realizsed they were going too far), a reminder that the mods are active, and means that if you do need to take more definite action, it&rsquo;s not an unpleasant, confusing surprise.</p>
<p>Thread should be locked if they are <em>actively</em> going astray and/or if the moderators do not want any more responses to it.</p>
<p>If you do delete or edit anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always, always mention what you did (unless it&rsquo;s very minor and self-explanatory, such as fixing a broken link). Be sure to contribute as @moderator.</li>
<li>If you delete a comment make sure it deserves it. Deleting anything looks extreme, will feel invasive to the writer, and makes it look they like they wrote something awful.</li>
<li>If someone asks what happened to a thread or a comment, answer them. You don&rsquo;t have to go into detail, but a) &ldquo;we deleted it&rdquo; (what) &ldquo;because it was basically spam&rdquo; (why) will be all most users need, or want to know. This is basic courtesy, a clear statement of where the line is, and makes sure that accidental forum glitches, or rogue moderators, don&rsquo;t go unnoticed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Onboard Communications</h4>
<p>There is an account with the handle @moderator. This account may interact just as others; posting, commenting, sending and receiving SeaMail. This account may be used when addressing issues publicly by choosing &ldquo;post as moderator&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Users send SeaMail to @Moderator, all mods are alerted. All mods will be able to reply via SeaMail using @moderator.</p>
<p>There is a forum category named &ldquo;Moderators Only&rdquo; that is only viewable by Moderator level accounts. Issues may be brought up with the moderation team for discussion by creating forum threads therein. Be sure to @mention someone if you need a quick response.</p>
<p>There will also be a group Sea Mail discussion for all mods to be able to communicate issues privately. Unlike forum posts, posts to the group Sea Mail will notify all moderators. @moderator Unlike forum posts, posts to the group Sea Mail will notify all moderators.</p>
<p>ANY issues should be raised behind the scenes, if only as a &lsquo;recorded for posterity&rsquo; thread. All moderators should be clear on how decisions are made and what they should do to find out what to do about something.</p>
<p>The intention is to post Moderation Information in the Forums so that Users may reference the guidelines.</p>
