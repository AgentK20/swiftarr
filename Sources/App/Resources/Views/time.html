                    JoCo Cruise will be making at least one time zone change this year. San Juan and Tortola are in Atlantic Standard 
                    Time while the rest of our voyage will be in Eastern Standard Time. Be careful when scheduling events 
                    that you take note of the expected time zone. The server that Twitarr runs on will be in UTC (Coordinated 
                    Universal Time, Greenwich Mean Time, Zero/Zulu time) for the duration of the cruise.
