# this is the TEMPLATE for making Swiftarr config files. The values in this file get set as environment vars
# (with setenv()) during Swiftarr app startup. If you haven't yet, you should make copies of this file,
# named `development.env` and `production.env`, and set up passwords for the databases and admin users.
#
# Swiftarr's git repo is set up so that any new files in `/Sources/Run/Private Swiftarr Config` are ignored.
# The .env files with sensitive passwords in them should not get checked in.

# Heroku note: Heroku sets DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, and (I think) PORT with appropritate values. Don't override
# them in a Heroku config.
